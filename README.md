# Coding Train Challenges in Godot

That was one of my takes on the challenges made by the YouTuber Daniel Shiffman from the channel The Coding Train. He uses JAVA to solve mathematical problems. These were the ones that I could try to make using Godot. These projects were made when I was learning how to use the tools at my disposal, so some may be glitchy or not work properly, and I plan on remaking them someday.

## How to Check the Results
1. Go to the `EXECUTAVEIS` folder and choose the project you want to see.
2. Download the .RAR file, extract it, and execute the .EXE file. (If the project has two .EXE files, you can choose either.)
3. The vast majority of the programs do not have interfaces and will start as soon as you start the program.
4. Some projects may have special commands, which I will explain later.

## Coding Challenges

### CODING CHALLENGE 001 -> Starfield Simulation
This one was a simulation of a 3D plane in a 2D canvas. It is a math problem that tries to show how perspective can emulate a moving object.

**How to use:**
- You can control the velocity of the particles by pressing the UP or DOWN arrow keys.

### CODING CHALLENGE 010 -> Maze Generator
This one was a challenge of how you can generate a random maze using an algorithm to check the next best possible way.

**How to use:**
- You can restart the maze by pressing the space bar.

### CODING CHALLENGE 021 -> Mandelbrot Set
This one is an illustration of the Mandelbrot set. It changes the color of every pixel on the screen to white or black. If it's white, it is out of the Mandelbrot set. This one is in urgent need of a remake because it is laggy. The way I chose to change the color was not optimal; it should have been made with a shader.

**How to use:**
- If you for some reason wish to see the redraw, you can press the space bar to restart.

</div>

### CODING CHALLENGE 033 -> Poisson-Disc Sample
This one is a graphical representation of the Poisson-disc sample algorithm. It is used to create multiple random points on a canvas where none of the points are too far away or too close to another point. The program is finished when the canvas only has blue dots.

**How to use:**
- If you wish to see another representation, you can press the space bar to restart.

</div>

### CODING CHALLENGE 054 -> Islamic Star Pattern
This one is a graphical representation of the classical Islamic tiles that you can see in buildings. It uses math to calculate the new shapes and create beautiful images.

**How to use:**
- You can use the sliders to change the size, quantity, and angles to create new images.
- You can use the color bars to change the colors of the lines.

</div>

### CODING CHALLENGE 056 -> Attraction Forces
This one is just an emulation of the attraction forces. The pink circles attract the white circles. The bigger the pink circle, the greater the force. The velocity of the white circle is obtained by calculating the influence of the pink circle's mass on the white circle's mass. The mass is represented by the size of the circle.

**How to use:**
- It has no special commands.

</div>

### CODING CHALLENGE 065 -> Binary Tree
This one is just an exemplification of the binary tree algorithm. It chooses a random number between 0 and 1000, then organizes it based on whether it is greater or smaller than the parent number.

**How to use:**
- Every time you press the space bar, you can see a new tree being generated.

### CODING CHALLENGE 115 -> Tabela de Curvas de Lissajous
This one shows a table of how different velocities in two circles change the moving trajectory of a third point.

**How to use:**
- It has no special commands.

### CODING CHALLENGE 126 -> Toothpick Fractal
This fractal creates an image using the rule that every line can only be connected by another line at each of its ends.

**How to use:**
- You can restart the animation by pressing the space bar.
- You can also add a new set of toothpicks using the right mouse button.

</div>

### CODING CHALLENGE 127 -> Floco de Neve de Árvore Browniana
This challenge is incomplete. It only shows a brief section of the snowflake. The way I was making this made it laggy and glitchy, so I chose to try again later. So, don't execute this one.

**How to use:**
- Don't use it.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34774a5b-3240-4df7-a929-924b1260594f" alt="Floco de Neve de Árvore Browniana GIF" width="300"/>

### CODING CHALLENGE 145 -> Raycast
This is a visual representation of the raycast algorithm. It is used to show how objects "see" in the virtual world.

**How to use:**
- Move the mouse to see what changes.

### CODING CHALLENGE 162 -> Self Avoiding Walk
This is a visual representation of how you can make something move through an area in a way that it checks every possible path and chooses one that touches every part of the path without crossing the same path twice. It is an inefficient way to move, but it is a certain way to verify that it will not collide with itself.

**How to use:**
- If it is taking too long to finish, you can restart by pressing the space bar. It will probably take too long to finish again.

### CODING CHALLENGE 180 -> Falling Sand
This simulates the behavior of falling sand. The challenge was about how to simulate this without using a physics engine and only working with the draw function to make the simulation.

**How to use:**
- you can deploy a single or multiple strand(s) of sand with the left mouse button.
- you can also enable or disable the deploy of multiple sand strands by pressing space bar.
